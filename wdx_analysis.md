# What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analysing (provide sufficient background information)?
Following extensive analysis to determine which project topics to pursue, I choose to analyze on this topic Agriculture because it is significant economic field in many countries, and agricultural activities provide food and income to large segments of the population. In this topic, I would like to discuss about the percent of agricultural land area, land under cereal production and cereal yield across period of time comparing different countries. In addition to it I would like to discuss about the male and female employment in agriculture and also agricultural raw material imports and exports.
# Why is it important to you and/or to others?
Analysing this subject is important to me because many people are unaware of how important agriculture is to a country's economy. I'd like to give you a comprehensive explanation of agriculture, including how much agricultural land is present, how much land produces cereals, and how agricultural productivity is measured.
# What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
Few of the questions I'm thinking about and would like answer are:
1. The total amount of agricultural land in each area.
2. The area of land used to grow cereals in hectares.
3. Per hectare, how many kilograms of cereals are produced?
4. Plotting the employment percentage of male and female in agriculture.
5. The total agricultural raw material imports and exports in each country.
# Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?
Datasets can be downloaded from World Development Explorer (WDX). As most of the data is available in datasets, it would be easier for processing the data.
# What process/step you use to analyze the situation/issue?
I analyzed the problem using Data Processing, bubble chart, scatter plot, and bar chart and line chart.
