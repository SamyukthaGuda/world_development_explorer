# What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analysing (provide sufficient background information)?
Following extensive analysis to determine which project topics to pursue, I choose to analyze on this topic Agriculture because it is significant economic field in many countries, and agricultural activities provide food and income to large segments of the population. In this topic, I would like to discuss about the percent of agricultural land area, land under cereal production and cereal yield across period of time comparing different countries. In addition to it I would like to discuss about the male and female employment in agriculture and also agricultural raw material imports and exports.
# Why is it important to you and/or to others?
Analysing this subject is important to me because many people are unaware of how important agriculture is to a country's economy. I'd like to give you a comprehensive explanation of agriculture, including how much agricultural land is present, how much land produces cereals, and how agricultural productivity is measured.
# What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
Few of the questions I'm thinking about and would like answer are:
1. The total amount of agricultural land in each area.
2. The area of land used to grow cereals in hectares.
3. Per hectare, how many kilograms of cereals are produced?
4. Plotting the employment percentage of male and female in agriculture.
5. The total agricultural raw material imports and exports in each country.
# Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?
Datasets can be downloaded from World Development Explorer (WDX). As most of the data is available in datasets, it would be easier for processing the data.
# What process/step you use to analyze the situation/issue?
I analyzed the problem using Data Processing, bubble chart, scatter plot, and bar chart and line chart.
# Agricultural raw materials Imports in 2016

Here, I chose Australia, Canada, China, Germany, and India to compare agricultural raw material imports.

In 2016, China has the highest imports at 3.5 percent of merchandise imports, while Australia has the lowest at 0.7 percent, with the rest of the world like India at 2 percent, Germany at 1.4 percent, and Canada at 0.9 percent.

Overall, China imports the most agricultural raw materials relative to the other countries.
# Cereal yield across different countries from 2010- 2018

I used a Line Graph to show the difference in cereal yield between Canada, China, Germany, and India over time.

Germany produces the highest cereal yield every year as compared to Canada, China, and India. Germany had the highest cereal yield in 2014, with 8050 kg per hectare while India's cereal yield in 2010 was the lowest at 2676 kg per hectare.

Every country's cereal yield fluctuates over time, increasing and decreasing, but it doesn't vary much in China, it only increases slightly.
# Cereal production (kg per hectare) of two countries in 2010

Here, I used a bubble chart to compare the percent of agricultural land, land under cereal production, and cereal yield between two countries, India and the United States, in order to examine the issue.

As seen above, the red color denotes the United States, while the blue color denotes India. As a result, in 2010, India had a much higher percentage of agricultural land (60.4%) than the United States (44.5%), and land under cereal cultivation in India is 100 million hectares, compared to the 57.5 million hectares in the United States. However, the cereal yield per hectare in the United States is 6978 kg, which is significantly higher than the 2676 kg yield in India.
# Employment of male and female in agriculture among different countries in 2013

In order to investigate the issue, I used a Scatter plot to compare the percent of male and female employment in agriculture in three countries: India, Canada, and the United States.

As shown above, the red color represents India, the blue color represents Canada, and the green color represents the United States. As a result, in 2013, India is the only country where female agricultural employment outnumbers male employment by about 16 percent with ratio of 59:43, while in Canada, male agricultural employment outnumbers female employment by 2.4 percent to 1.08 percent with ratio 2:1 and female employment in agriculture is 0.67 percent in the United States, while male employment is 1.87 percent.

From the above information it is clear that India's agricultural employment is much higher than that of Canada and the United States.

# Agricultural raw material imports and exports in 2000

Here, I used a 	Bar Graph to compare agricultural raw material imports and exports in four different countries: India, China, Canada, and the United States.

The red color represents China, the blue color represents Canada, the green color represents India, and the purple color represents the United States, as seen in the diagram above. As a result, in 2000, Canada's overall agricultural raw material imports accounted for 1.36 percent of merchandise imports, while exports accounted for 6.6 percent of total exports. China’s overall agricultural raw material imports accounted for 4.8 percent of merchandise imports, while exports accounted for 1.3 percent of total exports. India’s overall agricultural raw material imports accounted for 3.2 percent of merchandise imports, while exports accounted for 1.2 percent of total exports. United States overall agricultural raw material imports accounted for 1.3 percent of merchandise imports, while exports accounted for 2.3 percent of total exports.

Overall, the highest exports are recorded in Canada, while the lowest are recorded in China. China has the highest number of imports, while Canada has the lowest.
